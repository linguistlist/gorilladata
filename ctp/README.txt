FILE INFORMATION
This zip file contains WAV-audio files and annotations. The recordings were produced using a digital audio recorder (ZOOM H6) and can be listened to using any sound software that can play WAV-audio files. The annotations can be viewed and edited by the ELAN software packages.

RESEARCH QUESTION(S)
The data is the result of experiments related to the process of creating speech technologies to document a low-resourced or endangered language. The language that we picked for the creation of speech corpora and training of forced alignment tools is Eastern Chatino, an unwritten and low-resourced language from Oaxaca, Mexico. As far as we can tell, this is the first such resource available under a free Creative Commons license.
